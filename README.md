## Canary Deployment and Rollback
* Added [canary-deployment.yaml](https://github.com/j-Edge/sre-week-four/blob/main/upcommerce/templates/canary-deployment.yaml) and  [canary-service.yaml](https://github.com/j-Edge/sre-week-four/blob/main/upcommerce/templates/canary-service.yaml) for canary deployment.
* I did a few deployments and rollbacks to check out other helm/kube commands during different deployments. Terminal output of `helm history upcommerce -n sre` history below. <br><img width="692" alt="image" src="https://github.com/j-Edge/sre-week-four/assets/13790603/e5e7131b-9162-4b8c-980d-fd03eb56aeec">
